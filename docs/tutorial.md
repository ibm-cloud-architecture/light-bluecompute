# Tutorial

In this tutorial, you install and run a cloud-native microservices app on IBM Cloud™ by using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service as a [Kubernetes cluster](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/run/tool_ibm_container). The app implements a simple storefront that displays a catalog of computing devices. Users can see the product catalog from the app's web interface and know the details of the products. For a reference implementation diagram for the app, see [LightBlueCompute architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/light-bluecompute/blob/master/images/ref-arch.jpg).

As you install the app, you clone a [Git repository](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/tool_github/) (repo) that has several [microservices](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/microservices). With microservices, you can partition your app into smaller independent services that communicate with each other. This structure allows your app to be developed, deployed, and managed by different teams. By implementing microservices, you can incorporate the [Circuit Breaker pattern](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/manage/practice_circuit_breaker_pattern/) into your app so that the app can remain partially operational if a single microservice becomes unavailable.

When you install the app, these components are included:

- A web app that provides the user interface through the web browser.
- The web app also acts as a BFF component, following the [Backends for Frontends](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern. In this layer, front-end developers usually write back-end logic for the front end. The Web BFF is implemented by using the Node.js Express Framework. These microservices are packaged as Docker containers and are managed by a Kubernetes cluster.
- The BFF invokes a layer of reusable microservices that are written in Java™. The Java microservices run inside [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service) by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The Java microservices retrieve their data from databases. The catalog service retrieves items from [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). In this example, you run MySQL in a Docker container for development. In a production environment, it runs on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) layer, [IBM Cloud infrastructure](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=vpc).

## Prerequisites

1. You must have an IBM Cloud account. The account is free and provides access to everything you need to develop, track, plan, and deploy apps. [Sign up for a trial](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration?cm_mmc=IBMBluemixGarageMethod-_-MethodSite-_-10-19-15::12-31-18-_-bm_reg). The account requires an IBMid. If you don't have an IBMid, you can create one when you register.

If you're using an IBM Cloud user ID that was created as part of an IBM Cloud account that you don't manage, the Administrator service policy role must be assigned to your IBM Cloud user ID. Without that level of access, you can't create a cluster or deploy to a cluster by using the tools in this tutorial. To request the Administrator service policy role, contact the owner of your IBM Cloud account.

2. To install and test the app, your machine must be set up to run developer commands such as `git`.

- If you use a Linux system, make sure that you can run the commands and install the appropriate packages that allow you to do so.

- If you use a Windows system, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). After you download the file, open it and run the installation wizard. Accept all default installation options. After the installation is complete, on the command line, type `git` to see the Git instructions output.

- If you use a Mac system, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). For detailed instructions, see [Installing on Mac](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

4. Verify that Git is installed by entering this command in a terminal or on a command-line window:

```
git --version
```

You will see something like below.

```
$ git version
git version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)
```
## Task 1 - Install the IBM Cloud CLI and Container Service plug-in, the kubernetes CLI, and Helm

To install and test the app on IBM Cloud, you need these tools:

- IBM Cloud CLI
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in
- Kubernetes CLI ([kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/))
- [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), the Kubernetes package manager

1. The deployment requires the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in. Ensure that the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in is installed by entering this command:

```
ibmcloud ks help
```

If the plug-in is not installed, install the plug-in by entering this command:

```
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry -r 'IBM Cloud'
```

2. Install kubectl on your platform by following the instructions in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

3. Install Helm on your platform by following these [instructions](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md).

4. Ensure that the tools are installed by entering these commands:

```
ibmcloud --version
kubectl help
helm -h
```

You will see something like below.

```
$ ibmcloud --version
ibmcloud version 0.19.0+569dd56-2019-09-23T08:20:26+00:00
$ kubectl help
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.

5. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli&cm_mmc=IBMBluemixGarageMethod-_-MethodSite-_-10-19-15::12-31-18-_-ibmcloud-cli-install&_ga=2.9071408.428156231.1571349383-306001710.1571349383#install_use).

## Task 2 - Provision a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

Kubernetes is an open source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized apps. The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides a highly secure, native Kubernetes experience for rapidly building cloud-native apps. This tutorial uses the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service to create a managed Kubernetes cluster and deploy a cloud-native app to the cluster.

Two types of Kubernetes clusters are available in the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: Lite and Standard. The Lite tier is available at no cost. You can use it to provision a cluster with one worker node of type u1c.2x4 (2 core, 4 GB memory, 100 GB storage, 100 Mbps network). The Lite tier is sufficient to run the app.

With the Standard tier of the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can provision a cluster in a user-selected data center with a configurable number of worker nodes and a configurable number of worker node sizes. The cluster is provisioned in the linked IBM Cloud infrastructure account. With a Standard cluster, the ingress controller and load balancer are enabled.

For the purposes of this tutorial, you create a Lite Kubernetes cluster in the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.

1. From the menu, click **Kubernetes**.

![](../images/task4_kubernetes.png)

2. Now click on **Create cluster** under **Kubernetes** cluster.

![](../images/task4_create_cluster.png)

3. Select **Free** plan, name your cluster and then click **Create cluster**.

![](../images/task4_cluster_creation.png)

4. Wait till the cluster get created and you should be good to go once it is ready.

![](../images/task4_cluster_created.png)

## Task 3 - Deploy the app to the cluster

You packaged all the application components as [Kubernetes Helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts). You can now deploy the application by following the instructions to configure kubectl for access to the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Log in by using the API key to run the `kubectl` command.

```
ibmcloud login -a <your region's API endpoint> -r <your region> -g <your resource group> --apikey <your API key>
```

Get your api key by accessing `Manage > Access(IAM) > IBM Cloud API keys > Create an IBM Cloud API key`.

2. To set the Kubernetes environment variables, you need an export command. Retrieve the export command by entering the `ibmcloud ks cluster config` command:

```
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <clustername>
```

3. Copy the resulting export command, which looks like this example:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/Users/ibm/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/cloudnativedev/kube-config-prod-mel01-cloudnativedev.yml
```

Windows user would prefer the **SETX** command rather than **export**
```
SETX KUBECONFIG /Users/ibm/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/cloudnativedev/kube-config-prod-mel01-cloudnativedev.yml
```

Paste the export command on the command line and run it.

4. Initialize Helm in your cluster:

```
helm init
```

* Helm init has been removed from helm 3.0 You don't need it anymore. See: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6996#issuecomment-555010868

The Helm client and the server side component, tiller, are initialized.

5. Add the helm package repository that contains the reference application:

```
helm repo add ibm-light-bc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/light-bluecompute/master/lightbluecompute/charts/release
```

6. Install the reference application:

```
helm install --name bluecompute ibm-light-bc/lightbluecompute
```

In few seconds, the containers are deployed to the cluster. The output of the installation contains instructions to access the application after it is deployed.

NOTE: If you get an error message as follows, add a serviceaccount to deploy tiller as given below.

```
Error: release bluecompute failed: namespaces "default" is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default" cannot get resource "namespaces" in API group "" in the namespace "default"
```

Add a serviceaccount to deploy tiller.

```
kubectl --namespace kube-system create serviceaccount tiller

kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule \
 --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller

kubectl --namespace kube-system patch deploy tiller-deploy \
 -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccount":"tiller"}}}}'
```

For more information, see [Run a Cloud Native Microservices Application on a Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/light-bluecompute).

Also, there is an extended version of bluecompute. Currently, we are using light version of it for this tutorial. But if you wanted to check out more elaborate version of this app, refer to [Cloud Native Java Microservices - Reference implementation based on Kubernetes](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes). We have it implemented in both Springboot and Microprofile.

8. Copy the application URL and paste it into your browser. Create a bookmark of the URL.

![](../images/bc-home.png)

## Task 4 - Validate the app

The app is installed in your Kubernetes cluster. Now you can explore the app.

1. Click **Browse Item Catalog** to view the item catalog.

![](../images/bc-item-catalog.png)

2. Click one of the items to open the detail page.

![](../images/bc-item-description.png)

3. Explore the web app as much as you like.

## Task 5 - View the Kubernetes dashboard

The Kubernetes dashboard is the web-based user interface where you can deploy, modify, and view containerized application workloads on a Kubernetes cluster.

To see the dashboard, in the same command-line window where you deployed the app to the cluster, run the following commands. If you're using a different command-line window, complete step 1 and 2; otherwise, skip to step 3.

1. Log in to the application. If you need instructions to log in, see [step 5 of task 4](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/microservices-app-on-kubernetes?task=4).

2. To access the kubernetes dashboard, access your cluster and click on **Kubernetes Dashboard**.

3. The dashboard shows the different resources that are running on the cluster.

![](../images/task6_dashboard.png)

The BlueCompute app consists of different microservices, each of which are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster, as a deployment resource. Think of a deployment as the release unit of your app.

4. In the Workloads section, click **Deployments** to show the BlueCompute deployment resources that were installed.

Next, you'll explore pods. Pods are groups of containers that are deployed together on the same worker node. A pod is where the application code, which is packaged as a Docker container, runs under a Kubernetes context.

5. Click Pods to see the list of pods. Click a pod that starts with `bluecompute-catalogxxxx` to view the Catalog Pods page. On that page, you can check the pod runtime logs and see the Docker container instances.

Next, you'll explore services. Services are Kubernetes resources that define a logical set of pods and a policy to assess them. BlueCompute microservice components are exposed as services so that they can communicate among them and access each other. For example, the bluecompute-web service defines how users can access the web app.

6. In the "Discovery and Load balancing" section, click **Services** to see the list of services. From there, click **bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-service** to see what that service contains.

## Task 6 - Update the web application by using the Kubernetes CLI

In this task, you update the web app that you deployed in task 3 and scale it in your Kubernetes cluster. The web app is managed as a Kubernetes deployment component. You will see the deployment history and learn how to roll back the deployment to previous version.

Before you begin, be sure to complete task 3.

### Check out the code

Check out the `tutorial-task6` branch:

```
git checkout tutorial-task6
```

Go to the `StoreWebApp/public/resources/components/views` directory and open the `home.html` file in a code editor. Make sure that the header tag says `Updated for Tutorial Task 8` instead of `Bluecompute Store!`.

### Update the web app deployment with a new Docker image

In a typical Kubernetes deployment scenario, a developer completes these steps:

1. Change the application code.
2. Build a new Docker image with the new code changes.
3. Push the new Docker image to a Docker registry.
4. Deploy the new Docker image by updating the Kubernetes deployment.

To avoid spending too much time building Docker images in this tutorial, use the pre-built Docker image that was pushed to the ibmcase registry in Docker Hub. You can see the tutorial-task8 image on [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ibmcase/repository/docker/ibmcase/lightbluecompute-webapp/tags).

Kubernetes defines its components and deployment through sets of `.yaml` files. In this case, the web app deployment and services are defined in the `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` files. Take a minute to review this files if you can.

1. Confirm that KUBECONFIG is set:

a. Make sure that your command line has kubectl set up to configure the `bc-tutorial` cluster by entering this command:

```
kubectl config current-context
```

The command should return your cluster name:

```
bc-tutorial
```

If the command didn't return your cluster name, set the kube configuration by entering the `export KUBECONFIG=...` command.

b. From the output of the `ibmcloud ks cluster-config bc-tutorial` command, get the export command and run it. The export command looks like this example:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/Users/ibm/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/bc-tutorial/kube-config-hou02-bc-tutorial.yml
```

c. Enter the `kubectl config current-context` command again to confirm that kubectl is set to manage your bc-tutorial cluster.

2. Update the Docker image by entering this command:

```
kubectl set image deployment/bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment webapp=ibmcase/lightbluecompute-webapp:tutorial-task6
```
Where:

- `webapp` is the container name that is defined in the `deployment.yaml` file.
- `lightbluecompute-webapp` is the name of the new Docker image that was pushed to the Docker registry.
- `tutorial-task6` is the tag of the new Docker image that was pushed to the Docker registry.

3. Make sure that the deployment completed successfully by entering this command:

```
kubectl describe deploy bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment
```
From the output, verify that the `Image` name and the tag of the `Running` pods match what was set (`ibmcase/lightbluecompute-webapp:tutorial-task6`) in the previous step. You might need to scroll through the output to find the `Images(s)` section.

```

You updated the deployment's images and replicas.

4. Validate the web app.

Open the web app in a browser and verify that the new code is running. You can use the web app URL from Task 3, Step 4, or run two commands to get the app's IP address and port.

a. To get the IP address, enter one of these commands:

- On Mac or Linux systems, enter this command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="ExternalIP")].address}'
```

- On a Windows system, enter this command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath={.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type==\"ExternalIP\")].address}
```

b. To get the port, enter this command:

```
kubectl get service bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'
```

c. Open a new browser window and paste the URL, http://<ip>:<port>. The web page is displayed.

![](../images/task6_updated.png)

### Scale up deployment replicas

Scale up the number of pod replicas in the deployment. Pods are the runtime unit in Kubernetes. A pod contains one or more Docker containers.

1. Check how many replicas the deployment currently has by entering this command:

```
kubectl get deployment bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment
```

In the output, notice that in the CURRENT column, the deployment has 1 replica.

```
NAME                                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment   1/1     1            1           59m
```

2. Scale the deployment up to 2 replicas by entering this command:

```
kubectl scale deployment bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment --replicas=2
```

If the command was successful, this output is displayed:

```
deployment.extensions/bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment scaled
```

3. Verify that the deployment has 2 replicas by entering this command:

```
kubectl get deployment bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment
```

The CURRENT column how has 2 replicas:

```
NAME                                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment   2/2     2            2           61m
```

4. From the browser where the app is running, refresh the page and make sure that the app is still running.

### Roll back the web app deployment to its original conditions

1. Scale down the number of replicas in deployment to 1 by entering this command:

```
kubectl scale deployment bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment --replicas=1
```

This output indicates that the command was successful:

```
deployment.extensions/bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment scaled
```

2. Make sure that the deployment has 1 replica by entering this command:

```
kubectl get deployment bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment
```

In the output, check the CURRENT column. If the deployment has 1 replica, you scaled down the replica number successfully.

```
NAME                                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment   1/1     1            1           64m
```

3. Roll back the deployment to the original image by entering this command:

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment
```

This output indicates that the command was successful:

```
deployment.extensions/bluecompute-webapp-lightblue-deployment
```

4. In the browser where the web app is running, refresh the page. Make sure that your app looks like this example:

You rolled back the web app deployment!

## Task 7 - (Optional) Monitor the Kubernetes environment with Prometheus and Grafana

Cloud Service Management & Operations (CSMO) is important for cloud-native microservices-style apps.

To learn how to use the tools and services on IBM Cloud to implement CSMO for the microservice app, you can deploy a self-contained and independent monitoring stack into the Kubernetes cluster. Helm is Kubernetes package manager that facilitates the deployment of prepackaged, reusable Kubernetes resources. With the aid of Helm, the monitoring component, Prometheus, and the display component, Grafana, are deployed. After they are deployed, you can view the Grafana dashboard to monitor the app.

1. Get the below repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes-csmo.git

cd refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes-csmo/
```

2. Install the Grafana and Prometheus components.

To get the ibm cloud region information, run `ibmcloud regions`.

```
$ ibmcloud regions
Listing regions...

Name            Display name
au-syd          Sydney
jp-osa          Osaka
jp-tok          Tokyo
kr-seo          Seoul
eu-de           Frankfurt
eu-gb           London
us-south        Dallas
us-south-test   Dallas Test
us-east         Washington DC
```

To get the cluster id, run `ibmcloud clusters`.

```
$ ibmcloud ks clusters
OK
Name                 ID                                 State      Created        Workers   Location          Version                   Resource Group Name
bc-tutorial          4de24b6b12bd461cacc0a85fa75a84d2   normal     5 months ago   3         Dallas            1.15.4_1518*              default
```

3. On a Mac or Linux system, enter this command:

```
./install_csmo.sh <cluster-name> <ibmcloud-api-key> <ibmcloud-region> <namespace> <resource-group>
```

For instance it will be as follows.

```
./install_csmo.sh bc-tutorial xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx us-south default default
```

On a Windows system, enter this command:

```
install_csmo.bat <cluster-name> <ibmcloud-api-key> <ibmcloud-region> <namespace> <resource-group>
```

When the installation is completed, the Grafana URL and admin password are displayed.

4. Import the dashboards.

- On a Mac or Linux system, enter this command:

```
./import_dashboards.sh <grafana_url> <grafana_password>
```

- On a Windows system, enter this command:

```
import_dashboards.bat <grafana_url> <grafana_password>
```

5. You can now view the Grafana dashboard by typing the Grafana URL from step 2 in a web browser. For more information, see [CSMO for Kubernetes based Cloud Native Reference Application](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes-csmo).

## Task 8 - (Optional) Delete the app from the cluster

You can delete the app from your cluster by running the below command.

```
helm delete --purge <chart-name>
```

For example, it will be as follows.

```
$ helm delete --purge bluecompute
release "bluecompute" deleted
```

## What's next

Can be the same as the existing one.

## Appendix 1: Install Kubernetes by using the command line

To create the Kubernetes cluster from the command line, follow these steps.

1. Log in to IBM Cloud by using the `ibmcloud` command line.

If you are using a federated ID, use the `--sso` option.

```
ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com --sso
```

- Get the one time code by opening the URL that is returned to get a one-time passcode that you must enter when you are prompted.
- Select appropriate account.
- Then, select a region.

If you are not using a federated ID, use these options:

USERNAME: Your IBM Cloud user name
PASSWORD: Your IBM Cloud password

For all other parameters, press Enter to accept the default value
ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com –u <your_ibmcloud_username> -p <password>

2. Initialize the container service plugin.

```
ibmcloud ks init
```

3. Create and name your Lite cluster:

```
bx cs cluster-create --name <cluster-name>
```

For example, it will be something like below.

```
bx cs cluster-create --name bc-tutorial
The 'machine-type' flag was not specified. So a free cluster will be created.
Creating cluster...
OK
```
